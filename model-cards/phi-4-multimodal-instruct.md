Model Summary

Phi-4-multimodal-instruct is a lightweight open multimodal foundation model that leverages the language, vision, and speech research and datasets used for Phi-3.5 and 4.0 models. The model processes text, image, and audio inputs, generating text outputs, and comes with 128K token context length. The model underwent an enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) to support precise instruction adherence and safety measures.

Use Case Considerations

The model is not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models and multimodal models, as well as performance difference across languages, as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. Developers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including but not limited to privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case.

Release Notes

This release of Phi-4-multimodal-instruct is based on valuable user feedback from the Phi-3 series. Previously, users could use a speech recognition model to talk to the Mini and Vision models. To achieve this, users needed to use a pipeline of two models: one model to transcribe the audio to text, and another model for the language or vision tasks. This pipeline means that the core model was not provided the full breadth of input information – e.g. cannot directly observe multiple speakers, background noises, jointly align speech, vision, language information at the same time on the same representation space. With Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, a single new open model has been trained across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. The model employed new architecture, larger vocabulary for efficiency, multilingual, and multimodal support, and better post-training techniques were used for instruction following and function calling, as well as additional data leading to substantial gains on key multimodal capabilities. It is anticipated that Phi-4-multimodal-instruct will greatly benefit app developers and various use cases. The enthusiastic support for the Phi-4 series is greatly appreciated. Feedback on Phi-4 is welcomed and crucial to the model's evolution and improvement. Thank you for being part of this journey!

Tokenizer

Phi-4-multimodal-instruct supports a vocabulary size of up to 200064 tokens. The tokenizer files already provide placeholder tokens that can be used for downstream fine-tuning, but they can also be extended up to the model's vocabulary size.
Input Formats

Given the nature of the training data, the Phi-4-multimodal-instruct model is best suited for prompts using the chat format as follows:
Text chat format

This format is used for general conversation and instructions:

<|system|>You are a helpful assistant.<|end|><|user|>How to explain Internet for a medieval knight?<|end|><|assistant|>
Tool-enabled function-calling format

This format is used when the user wants the model to provide function calls based on the given tools. The user should provide the available tools in the system prompt, wrapped by <|tool|> and <|/tool|> tokens. The tools should be specified in JSON format, using a JSON dump structure. Example:

<|system|>You are a helpful assistant with some tools.<|tool|>[{"name": "get_weather_updates", "description": "Fetches weather updates for a given city using the RapidAPI Weather API.", "parameters": {"city": {"description": "The name of the city for which to retrieve weather information.", "type": "str", "default": "London"}}}]<|/tool|><|end|><|user|>What is the weather like in Paris today?<|end|><|assistant|>
Vision-Language Format

This format is used for conversation with image:

<|user|><|image_1|>Describe the image in detail.<|end|><|assistant|>

For multiple images, the user needs to insert multiple image placeholders in the prompt as below:

<|user|><|image_1|><|image_2|><|image_3|>Summarize the content of the images.<|end|><|assistant|>
Speech-Language Format

This format is used for various speech and audio tasks:

<|user|><|audio_1|>{task prompt}<|end|><|assistant|>

The task prompt can vary for different task. Automatic Speech Recognition:

<|user|><|audio_1|>Transcribe the audio clip into text.<|end|><|assistant|>

Automatic Speech Translation:

<|user|><|audio_1|>Translate the audio to {lang}.<|end|><|assistant|>

Automatic Speech Translation with chain-of-thoughts:

<|user|><|audio_1|>Transcribe the audio to text, and then translate the audio to {lang}. Use <sep> as a separator between the original transcript and the translation.<|end|><|assistant|>

Spoken-query Question Answering:

<|user|><|audio_1|><|end|><|assistant|>
Vision-Speech Format

This format is used for conversation with image and audio. The audio may contain query related to the image:

<|user|><|image_1|><|audio_1|><|end|><|assistant|>

For multiple images, the user needs to insert multiple image placeholders in the prompt as below:

<|user|><|image_1|><|image_2|><|image_3|><|audio_1|><|end|><|assistant|>

Vision

    Any common RGB/gray image format (e.g., (".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".ppm", ".bmp", ".pgm", ".tif", ".tiff", ".webp")) can be supported.
    Resolution depends on the GPU memory size. Higher resolution and more images will produce more tokens, thus using more GPU memory. During training, 64 crops can be supported. If it is a square image, the resolution would be around (8448 by 8448). For multiple-images, at most 64 frames can be supported, but with more frames as input, the resolution of each frame needs to be reduced to fit in the memory.

Audio

    Any audio format that can be loaded by soundfile package should be supported.
    To keep the satisfactory performance, maximum audio length is suggested to be 40s. For summarization tasks, the maximum audio length is suggested to 30 mins.

Training Datasets

Phi-4-multimodal-instruct's training data includes a wide variety of sources, totaling 5 trillion text tokens, and is a combination of

    publicly available documents filtered for quality, selected high-quality educational data, and code
    newly created synthetic, “textbook-like” data for the purpose of teaching math, coding, common sense reasoning, general knowledge of the world (e.g., science, daily activities, theory of mind, etc.)
    high quality human labeled data in chat format
    selected high-quality image-text interleave data
    synthetic and publicly available image, multi-image, and video data
    anonymized in-house speech-text pair data with strong/weak transcriptions
    selected high-quality publicly available and anonymized in-house speech data with task-specific supervisions
    selected synthetic speech data
    synthetic vision-speech data.

Focus was placed on the quality of data that could potentially improve the reasoning ability for the model, and the publicly available documents were filtered to contain a preferred level of knowledge. As an example, the result of a game in premier league on a particular day might be good training data for large foundation models, but such information was removed for the Phi-4-multimodal-instruct to leave more model capacity for reasoning for the model's small size. The data collection process involved sourcing information from publicly available documents, with a focus on filtering out undesirable documents and images. To safeguard privacy, image and text data sources were filtered to remove or scrub potentially personal data from the training data. The decontamination process involved normalizing and tokenizing the dataset, then generating and comparing n-grams between the target dataset and benchmark datasets. Samples with matching n-grams above a threshold were flagged as contaminated and removed from the dataset. A detailed contamination report was generated, summarizing the matched text, matching ratio, and filtered results for further analysis.
